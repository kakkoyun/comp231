/*
You may find it instructive to compare this implementation of merge
with the version in Cormen. Cormen's version involves n-1 memory allocations to sort an array of length n and allocates a total memory of O(n log n). This version performs a single memory allocation of size O(n).

Cormen's version also uses the extremely ugly and unnecessary idea of sentinels

The key to this difference is the idea of an "array segment" as our data definition.
